# Backtracking

#### A collection of backtracking algorithms written using Python to solve various problems.

Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively - removing solutions which don't satisfy the problem until all that remains are valid solutions.

The solutions are a notebook document used by [Jupyter Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) - an interactive computational environment allowing scientists to work with both Python and their data.

Current solutions include:

- a sudoko solver
- a program which takes a list of numbers and a required sum, and finds all of the numbers within the list which sum to this required value
